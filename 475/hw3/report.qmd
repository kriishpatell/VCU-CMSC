This is my calling card with my contact information, my major, and graduation date. I utilized green because it is my favorite color, and used serif style font give it that old school flair. 

The card transitions from green to purple, emphasizing my two favorite colors. 

## Board 2 - Connection

My first theme is *connection*.  Below is my storyboard.

I selected *connection* because I have been through a lot of life changing experiences and I learned that it is better to love than hate. One of the main experiences that I've had was watching Interstellar, which I think transitions nicely into my next card. 

I animated a spinning earth using emojis, which switch on a time interval

## Board 3 - Curiosity

This theme is *curiosity*.

I selected *curiosity* because I have always been curious about a lot of things, but astronomy has always highly piqued my interest. I often found myself researching astrophysics just for fun, not entirely grasping the concepts but just enjoying the facts. 

I animated this with a slight shake at the beginning and the rocketship flying across the panel

## Board 4 - Passion

This theme is *passion*.

I selected *passion* because I love volleyball. It introduced me to so many new people and new things and just a very welcoming community. I also very much enjoy the sport and hope to get better every day. 

I changed my initial idea for animation of a hitter spiking the ball into just a ball that bounces along the panel, as I found that it was a lot easier based on my current skillset. 

## Board 5 - Closing panel

Just want to thank the viewer for taking the time to learn more about me. The previous panels were some of the words that I think truly define who I am. 

I animated the page with it bouncing in from the top on repeat

# Reflection

I enjoyed the animation, there was a lot of trial and error, but I was able to figure it out eventually. I think that it would have been a lot better I worked in a more timely manner.
