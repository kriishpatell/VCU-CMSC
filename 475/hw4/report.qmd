# Introduction
The user should be able to navigate throughout all the panels and be able to visualize more about who I am and what defines me best. The story told in these panels is more to describe the different meanings behind some of the themes and how they describe me using animations and where those interpretations come from. 

# Panels to Include

This is my calling card with my contact information, my major, and graduation date.

## Panel 2: Connection

I selected *connection* because I have been through a lot of life changing experiences and I learned that it is better to love than hate. One of the main experiences that I've had was watching Interstellar and it emphasized heavily on the importance of connection with others and how there is power in unity, which I think transitions nicely into my next card. 

## Panel 3: Curiosity

I selected *curiosity* because I have always been curious about a lot of things, but astronomy has always highly piqued my interest. I often found myself researching astrophysics just for fun, and it truly astonishes me how much we have yet to explore. 

## Panel 4: Passion

I selected *passion* because I love volleyball. It introduced me to so many new people and new things and just a very welcoming community. I also very much enjoy the sport and hope to get better every day.

Just want to thank the viewer for taking the time to learn more about me. The previous panels were some of the words that I think truly define who I am. 

# Navigation Goals
I want the users to be able to learn more about me and have a fun experience navigating through the panels and interacting with the different cards. Some of the main messages that I want to convey are love and adventure that are indicated throughout the calling cards.

# Navigation Elements
Users will move through the different calling cards using mostly arrows. There is a section in the theme panels where you can select a specific panel using the specifier buttons on the bottom. Check mark buttons and reset buttons are provided for the user to indicate when they are done viewing or if they want to restart the journey. 

# Figma mockup
<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width=800 height=450 src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2F3wOBKq1UzBVtcePt55Cksj%2FHW4%3Fembed_host%3Dshare%26kind%3Dproto%26node-id%3D16-142%26page-id%3D0%253A1%26scaling%3Dmin-zoom%26starting-point-node-id%3D16%253A142%26t%3D9KfoV8AAUBi5c1H6-1%26type%3Ddesign%26mode%3Ddesign" data-external = "1" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The user should be able to navigate through the panels using the arrows that are provided and return to previous panels if they would like to take another look. 

# User Testing
I asked what they felt when they went through the panels and if there was anything that could make their experience more seamless. They responded that there were too many buttons, so I might make a change for that. I'm thinking maybe I implement some of the animated objects in my panels into the actual navigation. They also said that they liked the animations and that if they knew beforehand that the themed panels were about me, they would better understand the reasoning for them. 

# Reflection
I enjoyed working with Figma, however I think that my previous mockup made it difficult to implement the prototyping due to difficulties in transitioning between panels and making it smooth. I think that I would plan out how I wanted to navigate through the application before actually designing next time.
