## Board 1 - Contact Information

![](frame-1.png)

This is my calling card with my contact information, my major, and graduation date. I utilized green because it is my favorite color, and used serif style font give it that old school flair. 

I would probably want to have changing colors, maybe transition to a lavendar color palette. 

## Board 2 - Connection

My first theme is *connection*.  Below is my storyboard.

![](frame-2.png)

I selected *connection* because I have been through a lot of life changing experiences and I learned that it is better to love than hate. One of the main experiences that I've had was watching Interstellar, which I think transitions nicely into my next card. 

This could possibly be animated with a rotating earth. 

## Board 3 - Curiosity

This theme is *curiosity*.

![](frame-3.png)

I selected *curiosity* because I have always been curious about a lot of things, but astronomy has always highly piqued my interest. I often found myself researching astrophysics just for fun, not entirely grasping the concepts but just enjoying the facts. 

I plan to animate this with the rocket ship flying across the panel

## Board 4 - Passion

This theme is *passion*.

![](frame-4.png)

I selected *passion* because I love volleyball. It introduced me to so many new people and new things and just a very welcoming community. I also very much enjoy the sport and hope to get better every day. 

Although ambitious, I think that I would want to animate the hitter spiking the ball. 

## Board 5 - Closing panel

![](frame-5.png)

Just want to thank the viewer for taking the time to learn more about me. The previous panels were some of the words that I think truly define who I am. 

I want to animate the three words bouncing in from the top like a PowerPoint animation

# Reflection

It was alright, I was a little confused by the instructions and was not entirely sure what was exactly required. I would ask for clarification sooner next time.
